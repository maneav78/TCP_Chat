# TCP_Chat
Demonstration of command-line TCP chat application 

A simple command-line TCP chat application implemented in Python. This repository contains two scripts, server.py and client.py, enabling communication between a server and multiple clients. The server facilitates the chat room, while clients can connect, choose an alias, and exchange messages with each other. The code employs the socket and threading modules for handling network connections and concurrent communication.
